Games:
- make Zuber 2d game example from his assets and finish my 2d editor
- make 3d room for portal tests, add shooting portals and render to texture for now
- start to move multicraft code to new framework


Demos/Tests
- create simple system for switching and restarting demos

- simple empty demo
- loading and showing text from .ttf font
- loading and showing image
- loading image and creatig sprite from it
- loading image and creating 3d sprite from it
- loading .obj model with rotation
- loading .md2 model with rotation
- loading .md2 model with animation
- loading .md3 model with rotation
- loading .md3 model with animation
- loading .md5 model with rotation
- loading .md5 model with animation
- loading .mdl model with rotation
- loading .mdl model with animation
- checking for player input and drawing some info
- 3d camera using inputs
- network virtual controller
- loading music file and streaming it
- loading sounds intoo memory and playing it
- render to texture demo


Framework:
- add .md2 model format (quake2)
- add .md3 model format (quake3)
- add .md5 model format (doom3)
- add .mdl model format (half-life)
- port my code for loading .bsp maps (quake3 format)

- add frustum/aabb checking for camera
- optimize using of matrices in each render manager
- add option to convert textures colors in fly ex. from 8888 to 4444 etc.

- add 2d physic engines (jellyengine, box2d) and binaries for all platforms
- add 3d physic engine (bullet) and binaries for all platforms

- add VFS(virtual file system) from previous framework
- add encryption to it
- create some normal app to add files to it - not only c# but also c++
- add option to add files to it at runtime
- each filenema would be hashed - and info about file stored in map<hash,fileInfo>


PSP:
- change way sound manager loading sounds. Add way to distinguish sound formats and use proper method to load it.
- add code to swizzle textures / must be done in cleaver way because of function that can read pixels


IOS:
- OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer
- compile cAudio libraries for this platform 



MACOSX:
- compile cAudio libraries for this platform 


LINUX:
- compile cAudio libraries for this platform 
- update build script
- write better instrusctions how to compile framework on linux


Others:
- add Android support
- add Google NaCli support (when OpenGL ES 2.0 renderer will be ready)
