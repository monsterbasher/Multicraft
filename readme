Small framework for creating Windows and PSP games.
I will be using it for creating new Lamecraft (Minecraft for PSP clone).

Compilation under PSP:
- download latest unofficial psp sdk from http://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/
- check if in incl\Aurora\Utils\PlatformConfigurator.h #define AURORA_PSP is uncommented and #define AURORA_PC is commented
- run compile.bat

Compilation under Windows:
- make sure you have Visual Studio 2010 installed
- open Aurora.sln with VS2010
- check if in incl\Aurora\Utils\PlatformConfigurator.h #define AURORA_PSP is commented and #define AURORA_PC is uncommented
- run Build from Build menu
